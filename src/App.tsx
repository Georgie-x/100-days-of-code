				Created readme for Flagit and hosted on portfolio
				<a href='www.flagit.georgiex.co.uk'> Go to FlagIt</a>. Created this webpage and will host

				I want to be able to deploy this page automatically so I've set up GitHub Actions using this
				wizard <a href='https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-hostinger'>GitHub Actions instructions</a>. It was a good wizard and everything easier than I imagined, so I hope it works &#128522; Also adding a bit of CSS for a black and white theme.
