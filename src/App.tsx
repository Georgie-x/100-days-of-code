			<h1>Georgina Rimmer - 100 days of code</h1>
			<h2>Day 0</h2>
			<p>
				Created readme for previous project Flagit and hosted it on portfolio website{" "}
				<a href='https://flagit.georgiex.co.uk' target='blank'>
					Go to FlagIt Quiz
				</a>
				. Created this webpage and will host tomorrow.
			</p>
			<h2>Day 1</h2>
			<p>
				I want to be able to deploy this page automatically so I've set up GitHub Actions using this
				wizard{" "}
				<a href='https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-hostinger' target='blank'>
					GitHub Actions instructions
				</a>
				. It was a good wizard and everything easier than I imagined, so I hope it works &#128522;
				Also adding a bit of CSS for a black and white theme.
			</p>
			<h2>Day 3</h2>
			<p>
				I had a few troubles getting the GitHub Actions to work (wrong paths and I presumed it would
				sort out branches automatically) but it is now working so I plan to update some of my other
				websites with it.
